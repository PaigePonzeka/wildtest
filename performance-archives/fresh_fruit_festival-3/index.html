<p><em>Village Orpheus<br />
			By Mickey Bolmer<br />
			Produced by Poetic Theater Productions</em><br />
			Village Orpheus celebrates the vivacity, emerging sexual liberation and boldness of Greenwich Village in the 1950s and 60s. Focusing on Frank O’Hara’s central role in the artistic community, this neoclassical fantasy explores the parallels between the myth of Orpheus and O’Hara’s journey with his lover Joe LeSueur, as a chorus of New York bohemians sing art and the Village back to life and love.</p>

<p>			Julie d’Aubigny. Swordswoman. Opera Singer. Bisexual badass. In La Maupin this legendary 17th-century heroine lives again, in a fast-paced musical adventure. At her peak, Julie was a force to be reckoned with – bashing bigots, tumbling chambermaids, and performing some of Opera’s most iconic roles. Accounts vary; was she a lunatic or a martyr? A hero or a cautionary tale? Only one fact goes undisputed about Julie: She is a legend.<br />
			featuring Fight Direction by Jared Kirby!</p>

<p>			Pan is a queer punk-rock diva, and this is her last concert! Or is it? Her band can’t tell . . . this suicide talk’s not serious, is it? While they try to figure it out, wRETCH plays their set of riot grrrl-style proclamations on drugs, lesbianism, eating disorders, and taking up space. Get ready to smash the patriarchy, and maybe a guitar or two, at this bombastic all-woman rock extravaganza.</p>

<p><em>Asher Rhys Got Married Too Young<br />
			Featuring Adin Lenahan</em><br />

<p><em>Love Letters to Nobody, or Insignificant Others<br />
			Featuring Maybe Burke</em><br />
			Thursday 7/20, 7pm</p>
<p>			“People hide real feelings in a lie they call love.” In this series of letters to and from their insignificant others, Maybe tells pieces of a story about how identity, love, sex, and trauma all influence each other. This moving solo show takes a multilayered look at abuse, happiness, disappointment and hope; all through the lens of love, and sometimes, the lack thereof. Maybe Burke is an award-winning New York based director, choreographer, writer, performer, and trans advocate telling the stories that have yet to be told in mainstream American theatre.</p>
