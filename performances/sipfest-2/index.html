<p>SipFest, a new festival showcasing some of the coolest women theatremakers, has announced a lineup of multimedia works at different levels of development.</p>
<p>&#8220;When Spaceman was tragically postponed, we had this marvelous theatre that was going to sit empty for a few weeks. Taking a few hours to mourn, I immediately reached out to some of my favorite theatermakers and came up with a fierce lineup of groundbreaking women who will show deeply personal and totally fierce work.” said Loading Dock producer Charles Quittner. “Audiences will see readings, multimedia, puppetry, and of course a little drag.&#8221;</p>
<p>SipFest features theatrical works by Cherry Lou Sy, Asia Gagnon and Max Bernstein, Sofya Levitsky Weitz and Sarah Blush, Maiko Kikuchi, Kat Yen and Christopher Audley Puglisi and additional artists to be announced.</p>

In the summer of 1918, Antony returns from the war to his aunt and mother at their decaying estate by the sea — where something or someone is killing all the flowers in the garden. The Two Sisters is a contemporary queering of early twentieth-century anti-lynching plays, exploring gender performance, drag, ghosts, and the tension between artifice and the natural world. Recently developed by The Yale School of Drama, this workshop performance of The Two Sisters is Christopher Audley Puglisi’s New York City debut.<br />
